                    <p>“At Tashkent University of Technology, global partnership is not just a value — it is the
                        foundation of our entire
                        strategy. From day one, we have brought the world to Uzbekistan by focusing on what matters
                        most: people. Our team is
                        made up of faculty members, researchers, and professionals who have received their education and
                        training from leading
                        universities in more than 20 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom,
                        Germany, Japan, South Korea,
                        France, Malaysia, and many others.
                        They bring not only academic excellence but also a global perspective, cross-cultural
                        understanding, and a deep
                        commitment to transforming education and science. Thanks to them, New Uzbekistan University has
                        already become a space
                        where global ideas, intellectual traditions, and best practices come together.
                        On this strong foundation, we are building long-term strategic partnerships with some of the
                        world’s most renowned
                        institutions, including MIT (USA), the University of Cambridge (UK), and the Technical
                        University of Munich (Germany).
                        These alliances allow us not just to adopt best practices, but to co-create new models of
                        education and research —
                        collaboratively, equitably, and with a shared vision for the future of Uzbekistan and the wider
                        region.
                        Our goal is to become a globally recognized university, one that unites talent, knowledge, and
                        technology to tackle the
                        world’s most pressing challenges.</p>
