                    <h4>Commitment to Global Academic Excellence</h4>
                    <div class="hr"></div>
                    <p>Tashkent University of Technology (TTU) is committed to upholding the highest academic and
                        institutional excellence
                        standards. As part of this commitment, we are actively pursuing both institutional and
                        program-level accreditation to
                        ensure our degrees meet global recognition and quality benchmarks. Our accreditation journey
                        reflects our dedication to
                        continuous improvement, innovation, and alignment with international best practices.
                        Through strategic partnerships with globally recognized institutions such as the Massachusetts
                        Institute of Technology
                        (MIT), and the Technical University of Munich (TUM), we implement best practices in academic
                        quality assurance,
                        research, and student learning experiences.
                        Institutional Accreditation
                        TTU is currently working towards institutional accreditation through the Quality Assurance
                        Agency for Higher Education
                        (QAA), following the European Standards and Guidelines (ESG). This process ensures that our
                        university adheres to
                        internationally accepted standards of governance, academic integrity, and quality assurance.
                        Program Accreditation
                        In addition to institutional accreditation, TTU is in the process of securing program-specific
                        accreditations to enhance
                        the global recognition of our academic offerings. Our goal is to obtain accreditation for each
                        program from the most
                        relevant accrediting bodies, ensuring our graduates meet international industry and academic
                        standards. We are actively
                        working towards:
                        ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) for Engineering and Computing
                        programs.
                        ASCB (Accreditation Service for International Schools, Colleges & Universities) and other
                        specialized accrediting
                        agencies for business, social sciences, and applied sciences.
                        Additional accreditation bodies based on global best practices and industry alignment.
                        By securing these accreditations, we aim to strengthen TTU’s reputation as a world-class
                        institution that prepares
                        students for academic and professional success.</p>
